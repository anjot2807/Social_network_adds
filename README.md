A short description of each feature:

User ID: A unique identifier for each user.

Gender: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the user (Male/Female). This feature could be relevant for understanding potential gender-based patterns in purchasing behavior.

Age: Numerical variable representing the age of the user. Age is likely a significant factor in determining whether an individual makes a purchase, as different age groups may have distinct buying patterns.

Estimated Salary: Numerical variable indicating the estimated salary of the user. The salary might influence purchasing decisions, as individuals with higher salaries may have different spending behaviors.

Purchased: Binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the user made a purchase (1) or not (0). This is the target variable for modeling, representing the outcome you want to predict.


Purpose of Modeling: The goal of the modeling appears to be predicting whether a user will make a purchase based on their gender, age, and estimated salary. 
This is a binary classification problem where the model will learn patterns from the historical data to classify users into two categories: those who made a purchase (1) and those who did not (0).
